# Unikraft GSoC'22: Shadow Stack

<img width="100px" src="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/assets/media/gsoc-2022-badge.svg" align="right" />

The current implementation aims to bring the compiler based, LLVM `ShadowCallStack` to Unikraft apps.

Software based shadow stacks protect the return value of the functions by comparing whatâ€™s pushed into them with what resides in the traditional stack, practically, functioning as a backup and check storage.

What makes this project so different from other approaches is the complexity of the platform it targets.
Unikraft, a Unikernel Development Kit, provides applications which run in a single address space, the separation between user mode and kernel mode becoming, practically, nonexistent.

Thus, traditional means of using the compiler based `ShadowCallStack` can not be applied to Unikraft images.
More exactly, providing a runtime (not yet supported by LLVM's `compiler-rt`) for this security mechanism can not follow the path of using, for instance, the `arch_prctl` syscall, very nicely documented [here](https://gist.github.com/moyix/f2e101348209ddeb7eba903147a867aa).

Moreover, what's really so interesting about Unikraft is the ability of building images for a plethora of architectures and platforms, ergo, the initial goal of my GSoC project (Shadow Stack for `AArch64` based apps) could easily come to light while maintaning separation and modularity.

Following this idea, what had to be accomplished was modifying the bootstraping process (provided by the `ukboot` internal library), by inserting a constructor, whose sole purpose was to initialize the `x18` register with the protected stack.

Nevertheless, for more complex apps, such as `SQLite`, `Redis` and `Nginx` (already ported to Unikraft), initializing `x18` means altering the scheduling implementation (found in the `uksched` and `ukschedcoop` internal libraries), as multithreading becomes the norm.

## Main Contributions

The biggest part of my work went into crafting the **[Shadow Stack PR](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/505)**, which should be upstream once the `0.12 Epimetheus` Unikraft release is out.

This PR aims to bring Shadow Stack support to both simple and complex apps, even though work is still pending in order to fix some bugs regarding the multithreading Shadow Stack implementation.

## Sidequests

Besides providing the aforementioned PR, critical to the fully integration of my work was ensuring that the most used complex apps on the `AArch64` architecture were functional.

### Unikraft Summer of Code 2022

[Unikraft Summer of Code](https://unikraft.org/community/hackathons/usoc22/) is a unikernel and library OS workshop held every summer by the Unikraft community.

My contributions revolved around both reviewing and updating last year's content for the [Complex Applications session](https://unikraft.org/community/hackathons/usoc22/complex-applications/) and testing the content for the [Contributing to Unikraft session](https://unikraft.org/community/hackathons/usoc22/contributing-to-unikraft/).

For a better grasp of the work that went into it, check these 2 PRs:

* [Complex Applications PR](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/pull/102)

* [Contributing to Unikraft PR](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/pull/96)

## Roadmap

My journey for the second part of the GSoC mentorship was documented [here](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/utils/roadmap-scs.md).

For more detailed timestamps you can check our meeting notes:

**TODO**: insert meeting notes links here, after rd merges them

## Blog posts

During GSoC'22, I provided 3 blog posts which provide a comprehensive status quo for the 3 months that I was involved with Unikraft:

## Documentation

Documenting each and every step I took this summer was also one of my favourite activities.

The main 3 documents that highlight this passion are:

* [Shadow Stack for ARM vs x86](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/utils/doc-scs-arm-vs-x86.md)

* [Shadow Stack for simple apps on Unikraft](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/unikraft-scs/unikraft-scs-for-helloworld.md)

* [Shadow Stack for complex apps on Unikraft](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/unikraft-scs/unikraft-scs-for-complex-apps.md)

## Current status

My project, even though it followed the initial proposal quite accurately, provides Shadow Stack support for apps without multithreading.

## Future work

The first milestone to be achieved after GSoC'22 comes to an end is having multithreading Shadow Stack support.

Beautifying and easing the `make build` system for apps for which our users would like to have Shadow Stack support is also a top priority.

Reviewing current work done by the community towards modifying the [scheduling API](https://github.com/skuenzer/unikraft/tree/skuenzer/sched-refactor) and updating my implementation to fit these changes takes a big part in my planning for the future 2-3 months.

Nevertheless, investigating other security mechanisms related to Shadow Stack (such as `CET` and `Safe Stack`) and providing proposals as to how they would be integrated into the Unikraft ecosystem seems to be critical to [Unikraft's security](https://unikraft.org/docs/features/security/), as it heavily relies on the isolation provided by running in a virtualized medium, without any other significant security mechanisms being envolved.

As a part of my testing work, I also plan on continuing to test Unikraft apps on `AArch64` with various compilers. Some of these apps are: [`app-python3`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-python3), [`app-lua`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-lua), [`app-httpreply`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-httpreply).

Another thing which should be also be achieved is providing a series of patches for `newlib` in order to fix some `gcc`-isms that, for the time being, make the compilation of `AArch64` apps impossible using `clang`.
