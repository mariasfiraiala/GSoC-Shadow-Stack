# Unikraft GSoC'22: Shadow Stack

<img width="100px" src="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/assets/media/gsoc-2022-badge.svg" align="right" />

The current implementation aims to bring the compiler based, LLVM `ShadowCallStack` to Unikraft apps.

Software based shadow stacks protect the return value of the functions by comparing whatâ€™s pushed into them with what resides in the traditional stack, practically, functioning as a backup and check storage.

What makes this project so different from other approaches is the complexity of the platform it targets.
Unikraft, a Unikernel Development Kit, provides applications which run in a single address space, the separation between user mode and kernel mode becoming, practically, nonexistent.

Thus, traditional means of using the compiler based `ShadowCallStack` can not be applied to Unikraft images.
More exactly, providing a runtime (not yet supported by LLVM's `compiler-rt`) for this security mechanism can not follow the path of using, for instance, the `arch_prctl` syscall, very nicely documented [here](https://gist.github.com/moyix/f2e101348209ddeb7eba903147a867aa).

Moreover, what's really so interesting about Unikraft is the ability of building images for a plethora of architectures and platforms, ergo, the initial goal of my GSoC project (Shadow Stack for `AArch64` based apps) could easily come to light while maintaning separation and modularity.

Following this idea, what had to be accomplished was modifying the bootstraping process (provided by the `ukboot` internal library), by inserting a constructor, whose sole purpose was to initialize the `x18` register with the protected stack.

Nevertheless, for more complex apps, such as `SQLite`, `Redis` and `Nginx` (already ported to Unikraft), initializing `x18` means altering the scheduling implementation (found in the `uksched` and `ukschedcoop` internal libraries), as multithreading becomes the norm.

## Main Contributions

The biggest part of my work went into crafting the **[Shadow Stack PR](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/505)**, which should be upstream once the `0.12 Epimetheus` Unikraft release is out.

This PR aims to bring Shadow Stack support to both simple and complex apps, even though work is still pending in order to fix some bugs regarding the multithreading Shadow Stack implementation.

## Sidequests

Besides providing the aforementioned PR, critical to the fully integration of my work was ensuring that the most used complex apps on the `AArch64` architecture were functional.

perfectly describes the efforts made into that direction.

### Unikraft Summer of Code 2022

[Unikraft Summer of Code](https://unikraft.org/community/hackathons/usoc22/) is a unikernel and library OS workshop held every summer by the Unikraft community.

My contributions revolved around both reviewing and updating last year's content for the [Complex Applications session](https://unikraft.org/community/hackathons/usoc22/complex-applications/) and testing the content for the [Contributing to Unikraft session](https://unikraft.org/community/hackathons/usoc22/contributing-to-unikraft/).

For a better grasp of the work that went into it, check these 2 PRs:

* [Complex Applications PR](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/pull/102)

* [Contributing to Unikraft PR](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/pull/96)

## Roadmap

My journey for the second part of the GSoC mentorship was documented [here](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/utils/roadmap-scs.md).

For more detailed timestamps you can check our meeting notes:

**TODO**: insert meeting notes links here, after rd merges them

## Blog posts

During GSoC'22, I provided 3 blog posts which provide a comprehensive status quo for the 3 months that I was involved with Unikraft:

## Documentation

Documenting each and every step I took this summer was also one of my favourite activities.

The main 3 documents that highlight this passion are:

* [Shadow Stack for ARM vs x86](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/utils/doc-scs-arm-vs-x86.md)

* [Shadow Stack for simple apps on Unikraft](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/unikraft-scs/unikraft-scs-for-helloworld.md)

* [Shadow Stack for complex apps on Unikraft](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala/scs-work/blob/master/unikraft-scs/unikraft-scs-for-complex-apps.md)
